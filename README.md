# Number Guessing Game 

This is a simple Number Guessing Game built in Python as part of my SkillCraft Technology Internship â€“ Task 2.
The program allows the user to set a number range, and then try to guess the randomly chosen number.

Features

User can set a custom range for the game.

Program generates a random number within that range.

Provides hints (Too high / Too low) for each guess.

Tracks the number of attempts taken.

Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

How It Works

The user enters a starting and ending number.

The program selects a random number within that range.

The user guesses until the correct number is found.

The program displays the total attempts made.

Technologies Used

Python 3, Random module
